## Study Site

Sandy Point National Wildlife Refuge (SPNWR) in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, has one of the longest research and recovery programs for nesting leatherbacks under United States jurisdiction. Data from 44 years (1981-2025) worth of leatherback nesting data obtained from nightly monitoring at the Refuge and assessed for reproductive longevity, size at sexual maturity, and post maturation growth rates.
